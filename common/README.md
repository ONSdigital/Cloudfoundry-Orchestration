# Deployment Scripts

A collection of scripts that call the actual deployment scripts.  These have been written to extract as much of the scripting out of Jenkins as possible.

## Common files

- `common.sh`: common variables functions shared across all of the scripts

## Misc scripts

- `template.sh`: template for future scripts
