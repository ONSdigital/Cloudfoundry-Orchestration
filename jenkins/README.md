# Jenkins Deployment Scripts

Two scripts that allow deployment of Jenkins.

- `deploy_jenkins-local.sh`: deploys a local master or slave instance of Jenkins to the local machine
- `deploy_jenkins-cf.sh`: deploys a master Jenkins instance to Cloudfoundry

Detailed documentation can be found within the scripts.  The available options are detailed below the '# Parse options' comment.
